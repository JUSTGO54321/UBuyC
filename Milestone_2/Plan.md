## 2. Communication Tools

### Primary Communication Channels
- **Tool**: Discord
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Imessage, Instgram
  - **Justification**: Everyone already has discord and is very comfortable using it. We are also all active on Discord. It also has features to easily share code and discuss problems.

### Project Documentation and File Sharing
- **Tool**: GitHub
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Notion
  - **Justification**: GitHub and git are widely used applications to collaborate with others when writing code. Everyone in the team already has a few months of using GitHub as we all have 2 classes that require its use. 

### Code Collaboration
- **Tool**: GitHub (for version control and code review)
  - **Justification**: Same reason as above

- **Test Types**:
  - **Automated Testing**: Implement pre-written test suite after and during every build for core functionalities.
  - **User Testing**: User interacting with the program.
  - **Code Inspections**: Team members will review code for security, efficiency, and functionality.

- **Verification Justification**:
  - Verification is integrated into the project lifecycle to catch issues early. Automated tests and code reviews ensure functionality and efficiency before merging into the main branch.

### Crisis Response Plan
- **Contingency Planning**:
  - **Potential Disasters**: Team member illness, API limitations, critical bugs
  - **Response**: Document fallback options, prioritize issues, and reassign tasks as needed.
