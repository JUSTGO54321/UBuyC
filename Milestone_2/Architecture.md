# Software Architecture (example template)

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of our application, detailing each component in terms of its responsibilities, location (client or server), and communication patterns with other components.

### Controllers

#### **AuthorizationController**
- **Responsibility**: Define the purpose of this controller and its main operations.
- **Location**: (Client/Server/Both)
- **Communication**: What other components the component needs to communicate with and precisely what they will communicate.

#### **ListingController**
- **Responsibility**: Define the purpose of this controller and its main operations.
- **Location**: (Client/Server/Both)

## Component Stubs

Each component has been stubbed in source files within the repository. These stubs define the basic structure, with function headers, arguments, return values, preconditions, and postconditions for all inter-component requests.

### Example Stub: [Component Name]

```java
// File: [ComponentFileName.java]

/**
 * Function description
 * @param paramType paramName - Describe the parameter
 * @return returnType - Describe what is returned
 * @precondition - Preconditions for this function
 * @postcondition - Postconditions for this function
 */
public returnType functionName(paramType paramName) {
    // TODO: Replace with actual implementation
    return defaultValue;
}
```
