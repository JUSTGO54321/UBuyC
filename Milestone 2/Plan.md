## 5. Verification Plan

### Requirement Verification
| Requirement | Verification Method | Details and Justification |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| [Requirement 1] | Automated Tests | Run unit tests post-build |
| [Requirement 2] | Code Review | Scheduled reviews of logic and structure |
| [Requirement 3] | User Testing | Validate UI/UX functionality              |

- **Test Types**:
  - **Automated Testing**: Conduct automated tests after every build for core functionalities.
  - **Code Inspections**: Team members will review code for security, efficiency, and functionality.

- **Verification Justification**:
  - Verification is integrated into the project lifecycle to catch issues early. Automated tests and code reviews ensure functionality and efficiency before merging into the main branch.

### Crisis Response Plan
- **Contingency Planning**:
  - **Potential Disasters**: Team member illness, API limitations, critical bugs
  - **Response**: Document fallback options, prioritize issues, and reassign tasks as needed.
