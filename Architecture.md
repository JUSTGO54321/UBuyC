# Software Architecture (example template)

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of our application, detailing each component in terms of its responsibilities, location (client or server), and communication patterns with other components.

## Component Descriptions

### Models

#### **[Model Name]**
- **Responsibility**: Describe the specific function or data this model manages.
- **Location**: (Client/Server/Both)
- **Communication**:
  - **Interacting Components**: List each component that communicates with this model.
  - **Communication Details**:
    - What it receives or provides in interaction with each component.

---

### Controllers

#### **[Controller Name]**
- **Responsibility**: Define the purpose of this controller and its main operations.
- **Location**: (Client/Server/Both)
- **Communication**:
  - **Interacting Components**: List each component that interacts with this controller.
  - **Communication Details**:
    - What it receives or sends to other components and how it processes them.

---

### Views

#### **[View Name]**
- **Responsibility**: Explain what the view displays or allows the user to do.
- **Location**: (Client/Server/Both)
- **Communication**:
  - **Interacting Components**: List each component that communicates with this view.
  - **Communication Details**:
    - Specify the data or commands exchanged with other components.

## Component Stubs

Each component has been stubbed in source files within the repository. These stubs define the basic structure, with function headers, arguments, return values, preconditions, and postconditions for all inter-component requests.

### Example Stub: [Component Name]

```java
// File: [ComponentFileName.java]

/**
 * Function description
 * @param paramType paramName - Describe the parameter
 * @return returnType - Describe what is returned
 * @precondition - Preconditions for this function
 * @postcondition - Postconditions for this function
 */
public returnType functionName(paramType paramName) {
    // TODO: Replace with actual implementation
    return defaultValue;
}
```
